# BreadBox

Say goodbye to that rat's nest of breadboard wires. The BreadBox keeps your Arduino, Raspberry Pi experiments safe and solid. You can focus on your software, not on loose connections. You can even take your project to a local meet-up.

The BreadBox is an experimenter's kit made to hold your gear together so you can travel with it. No more having to figure out what came loose - the stuff that drives software folks crazy. This kit is designed to help a software person - like me - play with the analog world.

See a short [video of the BreadBox in action!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW6e7OaxT8A)                                   

Why? - I used to experiment with my Arduino using a typical bread board. Stick some wires into these holes, stick some other wires into those holes and viola, my experiment was under way. I'd write some software, put my setup on the shelf and go to bed. The next day I'd pull it down, run the software and something wouldn't work. Huh? Yep, one of those wires came loose. Find it, fix it, back in business... until I brushed the setup with my arm while reaching for a soda and something else came loose. What? Where? It drove me mad. And forget about taking my setup to a friend's house - no way it would travel. At one point I even pointed a web cam at my setup so I could show it to friends. It was all crazy. There had to be a better way for me, a software guy, to play with this new hardware. Out of my frustration the BreadBox was born.

What? - The BreadBox is a physically stable platform that is meant to travel without breaking. The upper platform holds servo motors and some input devices. The lower platform holds your microcontroller. The two are held together so nothing moves. It all fits in the logo box where it is kept safe (well, the interior isn't padded so I wouldn't ship it like this). You can pack up your kit and carry to a friend's house or meet-up. Or just keep it in the trunk of your car so you always have it with you. There's even room for a small USB power supply and a cable.

How? - Buy the BreadBox kit from [Jameco Electronics](http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/workshop/JamecoBuilds/arduino-breadbox-kit.html). It was featured in their newsletter!  If you want a logo box to carry your kit, [click here](http://www.shrimpware.com/rpi/index.html#howtoorder) for details. The assembly instructions are available in this GitHub repository and I think they're pretty good. You'll have to be able to do some rough soldering. I also provide some simple Arduino software you can use to get started. The software is not spectacular, just a place for you to start.

Any catch? - To be very clear, the BreadBox kit at Jameco does *not* come with any computer. You have to supply your own Arduino, or, Raspberry Pi, or whatever. I think it works best with an Arduino shield that gives you convenient places to plug in your cables. I've used it with both a Raspberry Pi Model B / Arduino Alamode combination and with a Arduino Yun / Sainsmart Sensor Shield (An Uno and Duemilanove also work. With other Arduino boards you might have to drill your own mounting holes in the BreadBox base - not hard to do!)

If you modify the software or write some new stuff, I hope you'll update this repository so that we can all share in the fun.
